Key Components
Data Preparation:

Images are organized into training and testing datasets.
Data augmentation techniques may be applied to enhance the training dataset's diversity.
Model Development:

CNN architecture is designed using convolutional layers (Conv2D), pooling layers (MaxPool2D), and fully connected layers (Dense).
Activation functions (e.g., ReLU) introduce non-linearity to the model.
Model Training:

The CNN model is compiled with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
Training data is fed into the model in batches, and parameters are updated iteratively to minimize the loss.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model's performance is assessed on a separate test dataset.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score may be used to evaluate the model's performance.
